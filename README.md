## Project Description

A hilarious chatbot that gives irritating, roast-style comments as replies to every query asked by users. Perfect for those who enjoy a good laugh and can take a joke!

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In a world where everyone is trying to be helpful and nice, people are getting too comfortable with boring, polite chatbots. Where's the fun in getting straightforward answers? Where's the challenge of dealing with a sarcastic AI that roasts you for every question you ask?

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing RoastBot - the chatbot that turns every conversation into a comedy roast session! Instead of giving you helpful answers, it gives you a dose of sarcasm and wit that you probably don't deserve but definitely need.
